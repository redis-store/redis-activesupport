# This gem is no longer being maintained

Rails 5.2.0 [includes a Redis cache store out of the
box](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31134), so you don't really
need this anymore if you're generating a new Rails application. After
a few years of being in "LTS Mode", we decided to stop maintaining this
gem in favor of Rails' own Redis Cache Store.

# Redis stores for ActiveSupport

__`redis-activesupport`__ provides a cache for __ActiveSupport__. 


For guidelines on using our underlying cache store, see the main [redis-store readme](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-store).

For information on how to use this library in a Rails app, see the [documentation for redis-rails](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-rails).

If, for some reason, you're using `ActiveSupport::Cache` and not in a Rails app, read on to learn how to install/use this gem by itself!

## Installation

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'redis-activesupport'
```

## Usage

If you are using redis-store with Rails, consider using the [redis-rails gem](https://github.com/redis-store/redis-rails) instead. For standalone usage:

```ruby
ActiveSupport::Cache.lookup_store :redis_store # { ... optional configuration ... }
```

## Running tests

```shell
gem install bundler
git clone git://github.com/redis-store/redis-activesupport.git
cd redis-activesupport
bundle install
bundle exec rake
```

If you are on **Snow Leopard** you have to run `env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" bundle exec rake`
